# Function-Overirding
Function overriding in C++ is a concept by which you can define a function of the same name and the same function signature (parameters and their data types)
in both the base class and derived class with a different function definition. 
It redefines a function of the base class inside the derived class, which overrides the base class function. 
Function overriding is an implementation of the run-time polymorphism. 
So, it overrides the function at the run-time of the program.
